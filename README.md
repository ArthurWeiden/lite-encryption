## Configurations

`rails g lite:encryption:install` will generate the following file:
`../config/initalizers/lite_encryption.rb`

```ruby
Lite::Encryption.configure do |config|
  config.secret_key_base = nil
  config.secret_key_salt = nil
end
```

`secret_key_base` and `secret_key_salt` should be supplied via environment variables or a secret
management system.

To generate a `secret_key_base`, execute `bundle exec rails secret` in the terminal prompt.
To generate a `secret_key_salt`, execute the following command in the Rails console prompt:
```ruby
SecureRandom.random_bytes(
  ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor.key_len
)
```
